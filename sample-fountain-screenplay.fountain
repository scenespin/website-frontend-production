# ACT I

= The opening act establishes our protagonist, Sarah Chen, a brilliant but disillusioned AI researcher who discovers her company's latest project has a dark secret. She must decide whether to expose the truth or protect her career.

[[Note: This act sets up the moral dilemma that drives the entire story. Sarah's character arc begins here.]]

INT. TECH LAB - NIGHT

The room hums with the sound of servers. Blue LED lights pulse in the darkness like a digital heartbeat.

SARAH CHEN (30s), sharp eyes behind thick-rimmed glasses, types furiously at a terminal. Her coffee sits cold and forgotten.

SARAH
(to herself)
Come on, come on...

She stops typing. Stares at the screen. Her expression shifts from concentration to disbelief.

SARAH
No. That can't be right.

SARAH
(reading from screen)
"Project Phoenix: Neural mapping protocol..."

She scrolls down. Her face pales.

SARAH
(whispering)
They're using human subjects. Without consent.

The door handle TURNS. Sarah quickly closes the window, but not fast enough.

DR. MARCUS WELLS (50s), impeccably dressed, enters. He notices her startled expression.

DR. WELLS
Working late again, Sarah?

SARAH
(forcing a smile)
Just finishing up some analysis.

DR. WELLS
Good. Because we need to talk about your future here.

He moves closer. Too close.

DR. WELLS
The board is very impressed with your work on Project Phoenix. Very impressed.

Sarah's hands tremble slightly. She hides them under the desk.

SARAH
I'm... honored.

DR. WELLS
You should be. This could be your ticket to the executive suite.

He pauses. Studies her face.

DR. WELLS
Unless something were to... derail it.

[[Note: This scene establishes the power dynamic and the threat Sarah faces.]]

INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - LATER

Sarah paces her small apartment, phone pressed to her ear.

SARAH
(into phone)
I don't know what to do, David. This is bigger than I thought.

DAVID (O.S.)
(V.O.)
You need to get out of there. Now.

SARAH
I can't just walk away. Not without evidence.

DAVID (O.S.)
(V.O.)
Evidence of what? You said yourself the files are encrypted.

Sarah stops pacing. Looks at her laptop, open on the coffee table.

SARAH
I have a way in. But if they catch me...

DAVID (O.S.)
(V.O.)
Sarah, listen to me. This isn't worth your life.

SARAH
(quietly)
It might be worth theirs.

She hangs up. Opens her laptop. Types a password. The screen lights up with classified documents.

[[Note: Sarah's decision point - she chooses to investigate despite the risk.]]

INT. TECH LAB - NEXT DAY

Sarah arrives early. The lab is empty. Perfect.

She approaches the secure server room. Swipes her access card. The door BEEPS and opens.

Inside, rows of servers blink in the darkness. Sarah finds the terminal she needs. Sits down. Takes a deep breath.

SARAH
Here goes nothing.

She plugs in a USB drive. The terminal screen flickers. A progress bar appears.

PROGRESS: 15%... 30%... 45%...

Footsteps echo in the hallway. Getting closer.

Sarah's eyes dart to the door. The progress bar hits 60%.

FOOTSTEPS stop outside the door.

SARAH
(whispering)
Come on, come on...

75%... 90%... 100%

COMPLETE.

Sarah yanks the USB drive. The door handle TURNS.

She dives behind a server rack just as DR. WELLS enters.

DR. WELLS
Sarah? Are you in here?

Sarah holds her breath. Peers through the server rack. Wells scans the room. His eyes land on the terminal she just used.

Still warm.

DR. WELLS
(suspicious)
Interesting.

He pulls out his phone. Dials a number.

DR. WELLS
(into phone)
Security. I need a full audit of server access logs. Now.

Sarah's eyes widen. She's been caught. Or has she?

[[Note: The tension escalates - will Sarah escape or be discovered?]]

# ACT II

= Sarah escapes with the evidence but realizes the conspiracy goes deeper than she imagined. She must form an unlikely alliance with a whistleblower from inside the company while evading both corporate security and shadowy figures who want the technology for themselves.

[[Note: Act II raises the stakes and introduces new allies and enemies.]]

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

Rain POUNDS against the concrete. Sarah runs through the garage, clutching her laptop bag.

Behind her, TWO MEN IN SUITS pursue her. They're fast. Professional.

SARAH
(breathless)
Shit, shit, shit...

She rounds a corner. Sees her car. Fumbles for her keys. Drops them.

The men are closing in. Twenty feet. Ten.

Sarah scoops up the keys. Unlocks the car. Jumps inside.

The engine ROARS to life. She peels out just as the men reach her parking spot.

SARAH
(driving)
Okay. Okay. I'm okay.

She checks her rearview mirror. A black sedan follows. Matching her speed. Matching her turns.

SARAH
You've got to be kidding me.

She takes a sharp turn. The sedan follows. Too close. Too skilled.

This isn't corporate security. These are professionals.

[[Note: The chase scene establishes that Sarah is dealing with something more dangerous than she realized.]]

INT. SAFE HOUSE - LATER

A dingy apartment. The kind you rent by the hour. Sarah sits at a small table, laptop open.

She's been here for three days. Living on takeout and fear.

A KNOCK at the door. Three quick raps. A pause. Two more.

The signal.

Sarah opens the door. A woman in her 40s enters. JANET MORALES, former company lawyer turned whistleblower.

JANET
You look like hell.

SARAH
Thanks. You should see the other guy.

Janet sets down a briefcase. Opens it. Pulls out files.

JANET
I've been tracking this for months. Project Phoenix isn't just unethical. It's illegal. And it's not just your company.

SARAH
What do you mean?

JANET
(shows her documents)
Three other tech companies. Same protocol. Same human testing. All coordinated.

Sarah studies the documents. Her stomach drops.

SARAH
This is bigger than I thought.

JANET
Much bigger. And the people behind it? They don't play nice.

Janet points to a photo. A man in a suit. Unremarkable. Dangerous.

JANET
This is Agent Black. He's the one who made my last partner disappear.

SARAH
Disappear?

JANET
(dead serious)
Permanently.

[[Note: Janet introduces the true scope of the conspiracy and the real danger Sarah faces.]]

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Sarah and Janet set up their operation. Laptops. Encrypted servers. Coffee. Lots of coffee.

SARAH
So what's the plan?

JANET
We leak everything. All at once. To every major news outlet. Make it too big to cover up.

SARAH
And if they find us first?

JANET
Then we make sure the data gets out anyway. Dead man's switch.

Sarah processes this. Nods slowly.

SARAH
Okay. Let's do it.

They work in silence. Hours pass. The files compile. The encryption breaks. The truth emerges.

Janet's phone BUZZES. She checks it. Goes pale.

JANET
They found us.

SARAH
How?

JANET
Doesn't matter. We have ten minutes. Maybe less.

Sarah looks at the progress bar on her screen.

SARAH
I need five more minutes.

JANET
We don't have five minutes.

Headlights sweep across the warehouse windows. Engines ROAR outside.

JANET
They're here.

[[Note: The climax of Act II - will they escape with the evidence?]]

# ACT III

= Sarah and Janet must make a desperate last stand, using the evidence they've gathered to expose the conspiracy while fighting for their lives. The truth will come out, but at what cost?

[[Note: The final act resolves the central conflict and shows the consequences of Sarah's choices.]]

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Sarah frantically works at her terminal. The upload progress: 67%... 68%... 69%...

JANET
(peering through window)
They're surrounding the building. At least six men.

SARAH
Almost there. 72%...

GUNSHOTS ring out. The warehouse door EXPLODES inward. Men in tactical gear pour in.

JANET
Time's up!

She grabs a flash drive. Tosses it to Sarah.

JANET
Backup copy. Get out of here!

SARAH
I'm not leaving you!

JANET
You have to! The truth is more important than either of us!

Sarah hesitates. Then nods. Grabs her laptop. Runs for the back exit.

Behind her, Janet stands her ground. A hero's last stand.

SARAH
(whispering)
I'm sorry.

She bursts through the back door. Into the night. The sound of gunfire follows her.

[[Note: Janet's sacrifice raises the emotional stakes and shows what's truly at risk.]]

EXT. CITY STREETS - LATER

Sarah runs. No destination. Just away.

Her phone BUZZES. She checks it. A notification.

"Upload Complete."

She stops. Stares at the screen. It worked. The files are out. The truth is free.

SARAH
(breathing heavily)
We did it, Janet. We did it.

A car pulls up beside her. Black sedan. The window rolls down.

AGENT BLACK sits inside. Calm. Professional. Deadly.

AGENT BLACK
Get in, Ms. Chen.

Sarah looks at him. Looks at her phone. The notification still glowing.

SARAH
The truth is already out. You can't stop it now.

AGENT BLACK
(smiles)
Who said I wanted to stop it?

Sarah's confusion shows. Black opens the door.

AGENT BLACK
I wanted to make sure it got out. You just did my job for me.

[[Note: The twist - Agent Black was working against the conspiracy all along, using Sarah as an unwitting ally.]]

INT. GOVERNMENT OFFICE - ONE WEEK LATER

Sarah sits across from Agent Black. A file folder between them.

AGENT BLACK
The investigation is moving forward. Three companies. Twelve executives. All facing charges.

SARAH
And Janet?

AGENT BLACK
(sadly)
We couldn't save her. But her sacrifice wasn't in vain.

He slides the folder across the desk.

AGENT BLACK
We'd like to offer you a position. Covert operations. Tech division.

SARAH
You want me to work for you?

AGENT BLACK
We want you to help us stop the next Project Phoenix before it starts.

Sarah considers. Looks out the window. The city sprawls below. Full of secrets. Full of truth.

SARAH
When do I start?

FADE TO BLACK.

[[Note: Sarah's journey comes full circle - from discovering the truth to becoming part of the solution.]]

THE END
